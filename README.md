# parlament-scraper
Scraper that is scraping members of Croatian parlament from official website

At the moment it is only usable from REPL. To start, download this repo, run `cabal repl` and than `newScrape saziv "sanitized-name-for-this-scrape"` to save all scraped nicely formated in `scrapes/sanitized-name-for-this-scrape` directory.
